# Block access to all hidden files and directories with the exception of the
# visible content from within the `/.well-known/` hidden directory.
#
# These types of files usually contain user preferences or the preserved state
# of a utility, and can include rather private places like, for example, the
# `.git` or `.svn` directories.
#
# The `/.well-known/` directory represents the standard (RFC 5785) path prefix
# for "well-known locations" (e.g.: `/.well-known/manifest.json`,
# `/.well-known/keybase.txt`), and therefore, access to its visible content
# should not be blocked.

# Block access to files that can expose sensitive information.

# By default, block access to backup and source files that may be left by some
# text editors and can pose a security risk when anyone has access to them.
