# Enable gzip compression.
# Default: off
gzip on;

# Compression level (1-9).
# 5 is a perfect compromise between size and CPU usage, offering about 75%
# reduction for most ASCII files (almost identical to level 9).
# Default: 1
gzip_comp_level 5;

# Don't compress anything that's already small and unlikely to shrink much if at
# all (the default is 20 bytes, which is bad as that usually leads to larger
# files after gzipping).
# Default: 20
gzip_min_length 256;

# Compress data even for clients that are connecting to us via proxies,
# identified by the "Via" header (required for CloudFront).
# Default: off
gzip_proxied any;

# Tell proxies to cache both the gzipped and regular version of a resource
# whenever the client's Accept-Encoding capabilities header varies;
# Avoids the issue where a non-gzip capable client (which is extremely rare
# today) would display gibberish if their proxy gave them the gzipped version.
# Default: off
gzip_vary on;

# Compress all output labeled with one of the following MIME-types.
# `text/html` is always compressed by gzip module.
# Default: text/html
