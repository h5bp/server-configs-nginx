# Protect website reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
#
# (1) Try to re-enable the cross-site scripting (XSS) filter built into most
#     web browsers.
#
#     The filter is usually enabled by default, but in some cases it may be
#     disabled by the user. However, in Internet Explorer for example, it can be
#     re-enabled just by sending the  `X-XSS-Protection` header with the value
#     of `1`.
#
# (2) Prevent web browsers from rendering the web page if a potential reflected
#     (a.k.a non-persistent) XSS attack is detected by the filter.
#
#     By default, if the filter is enabled and browsers detect a reflected XSS
#     attack, they will attempt to block the attack by making the smallest
#     possible modifications to the returned web page.
#
#     Unfortunately, in some browsers (e.g.: Internet Explorer), this default
#     behavior may allow the XSS filter to be exploited. Therefore, it's better
#     to inform browsers to prevent the rendering of the page altogether,
#     instead of attempting to modify it.

#
# (!) Do not rely on the XSS filter to prevent XSS attacks! Ensure that you are
#     taking all possible measures to prevent XSS attacks, the most obvious
#     being: validating and sanitizing your website's inputs.
