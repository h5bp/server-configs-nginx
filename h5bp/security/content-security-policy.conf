# Mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting and other content-injection
# attacks.
#
# This can be done by setting a Content Security Policy which permits
# trusted sources of content for your website.
#
# There is no policy that fits all websites, you will have to modify the
# `Content-Security-Policy` directives in the example depending on your needs.
#
# To make your CSP implementation easier, you can use an online CSP header
# generator such as:
# https://report-uri.com/home/generate/
#
# It is encouraged that you validate your CSP header using a CSP validator
# such as:
# https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com
#
# https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/
# https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/#content-security-policy
# https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy

add_header Content-Security-Policy $content_security_policy always;
