# Mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting and other content-injection
# attacks.
#
# This can be done by setting a `Content Security Policy` which
# whitelists trusted sources of content for your website.
#
# The example header below allows ONLY scripts that are loaded from
# the current website's origin (no inline scripts, no CDN, etc).
# That almost certainly won't work as-is for your website!
#
# To make things easier, you can use an online CSP header generator
# such as: https://www.cspisawesome.com/.
