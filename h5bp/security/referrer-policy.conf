# A web application uses HTTPS and a URL-based session identifier.
# The web application might wish to link to HTTPS resources on other web
# sites without leaking the user's session identifier in the URL.
#
# This can be done by setting a `Referrer Policy` which whitelists trusted
# sources of content for your website.
#
# To check your referrer policy, you can use an online service such as:
# https://securityheaders.io/.
